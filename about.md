Hi! My name is Jonathon Sturdevant and I am currently the Chief Technology Officer for Tuesday Night Software.

I attended [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu) in the early 2000's and have been working the software engineering industry for more than a decade. I have experience working primarily in the web domain - using mostly the Java language. I started looking at some different languages after attending a [No Fluff Just Stuff](https://nofluffjuststuff.com) conference and I was asked the question - "If you could change one thing about Java, what would it be?" I really didn't know, because I didn't have much experience with other languages. I decided that I would challenge myself to learn other development languages so I could answer that question. Since then, I've looked at other languages and I wouldn't call myself an expert in any of them, but I have definitely found room for improvement in the Java language that I've made my career on.

Right now, I really enjoy coding in a language that is just as old as Java - Ruby. It isn't for everyone, but I really enjoy the flexibility that Ruby provides. There is, of course, some room for improvement in the Ruby language as well.

Additionally, I look at efficiency improvements that could be made to help with producing high quality software quicker. There are a lot of people already in this space that have a lot of opinions on how things should be done. I don't know how things will work out, but I want to put my opinion out there. If nothing else, maybe I can reference this later on how or why I did something.
